# TURTLEBOT(s) navigation: "Cut & Glue" trajectories
This project aims to develop an autonomous TurtleBot capable of navigating flat indoor terrain using advanced robotics and motion planning techniques within the ROS environment. Equipped with LiDAR and powerful motor control, the TurtleBot 3 Burger serves as the ideal platform for this endeavor.

## Objectives:
1. Understand mobile robot dynamics and planning methods.
2. Assemble and integrate TurtleBot 3 with ROS.
3. Develop and implement planning algorithms in simulation and in real world.
4. Conduct a series of experiments to evaluate the navigation system's performance under various scenarios and associated costs.

## Setup:

### Setup: Pre-requisites
This project was made and used on ROS Humble with ubuntu 22.04 in mind. Please ensure you have HUmble or a compatable version of ROS setup up with the dependency packages for this project including SLAM-cargographer, ros2-navigation and turtlebot3 and colcon build tools If you need an in detail set by step guide on setting up your envrionment ([tutorial](https://gitlab.eeecs.qub.ac.uk/40294886/turtlebot_navigation-cut_and_glue_trajectories/-/blob/b33d09b1353e20f2beaf6e88cc33a92bc51d501b/documentation/ros2_turtlebot3_setup_guide.md))

### Setup: Install
Clone the reporitory in your colcon ros2 workspace.
```bash
cd ~/ros2_ws/src
git clone https://gitlab.eeecs.qub.ac.uk/40294886/turtlebot_navigation-cut_and_glue_trajectories.git
```

Install dependencies for the the ros packages in the project.
```bash
cd ~.ros2_ws/ && rosdep install --from-paths src --ignore-src -r -y
```

Build the colcon workspace using symlink-install for workspace storage otimzation improved package management
```bash
cd ~/ros2_ws/ && colcon build --symlink-install
```

Source the project ()this will source the setup.bash file for bootstrapping your ros2_ws for use within your ros environment, only add this once) 
```bash
echo "source ~/ros2_ws/install/setup.bash" >> ~/.bashrc
```
you should now be able to run any of the packages wihin the turtlebot3_navigtaion2_tutorials folder.

## Project structure
### documenation
Contains documentation related to the project, including the dissertation, guides for ROS setup, diagrams for project architectures, and any additional documentation needed throughout the project.

#### launch_scripts
Here's the revised version with improved spelling, formatting, and added clarity:
Project Structure
Documentation

Contains documentation related to the project, including the dissertation, guides for ROS setup, diagrams for project architectures, and any additional documentation needed throughout the project.
Launch Scripts

Contains bash scripts for launching nav2_launch files, both for real and simulation environments. These scripts experiment with different global planners, including default planners such as Dijkstra and A*, as well as our custom planner server implementations (RRT, A*, and Dijkstra). 

#### maps
Contains the 2D occupancy grid PGM files and associated YAML files generated by SLAM. These files are utilized by the Navigation2 stack for different environments tested during the project.

#### params
This folder contains custom param.xml files used by the Navigation2 stack to define behavior trees. These param.xml files have been customized to use different planner algorithms, including default Dijkstra, A*, and our custom planner server.

#### pkgs
This is the main directory of our project, containing several ROS 2 packages:
- custom_planner_plugin: Contains the code for our custom_planner_plguin ([information](<./pkgs/custom_planner_plugin/README.md>))
- wall_follower: This is the wall follower algorithms which has the robot drive around the edges of the maps ([information](./pkgs/wall_follower/README.md))

## Dissertation
The outcomes of this project, along with discussions on experiment implementation and other relevant details, are documented in my dissertation: ([link](./documentation/dissertation/mckee_ryan_40294886__Dissertation.docx))
