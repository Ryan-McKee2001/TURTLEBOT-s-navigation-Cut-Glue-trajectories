# TurtleBot(s) Navigation: "Cut & Glue" Trajectories

This project aimed to develop an autonomous TurtleBot capable of navigating flat indoor terrain using advanced robotics and motion planning techniques within the ROS environment. Equipped with LiDAR and powerful motor control, the TurtleBot 3 Burger serves as the ideal platform for this endeavor.

## Objectives

1. Understand mobile robot dynamics and planning methods.
2. Assemble and integrate TurtleBot 3 with ROS.
3. Develop and implement planning algorithms in simulation and in real world.
4. Conduct a series of experiments to evaluate the navigation system's performance under various scenarios and associated costs.

## Setup

### Prerequisites

This project was developed using ROS Humble with Ubuntu 22.04. Ensure you have ROS Humble or a compatible version of ROS set up along with the dependency packages for this project, including SLAM Cartographer, ros2-navigation, turtlebot3, and colcon build tools. For a detailed step-by-step guide on setting up your environment, refer to the [setup guide](https://gitlab.eeecs.qub.ac.uk/40294886/turtlebot_navigation-cut_and_glue_trajectories/-/blob/b33d09b1353e20f2beaf6e88cc33a92bc51d501b/documentation/ros2_turtlebot3_setup_guide.md).

### Installation

1. Clone the repository into your colcon ROS 2 workspace:
    ```bash
    cd ~/ros2_ws/src
    git clone https://gitlab.eeecs.qub.ac.uk/40294886/turtlebot_navigation-cut_and_glue_trajectories.git
    ```

2. Install dependencies for the ROS packages in the project:
    ```bash
    cd ~/ros2_ws/
    rosdep install --from-paths src --ignore-src -r -y
    ```

3. Build the colcon workspace using symlink-install for workspace storage optimization and improved package management:
    ```bash
    cd ~/ros2_ws/
    colcon build --symlink-install
    ```

4. Source the project (this will source the `setup.bash` file for bootstrapping your `ros2_ws` for use within your ROS environment):
    ```bash
    echo "source ~/ros2_ws/install/setup.bash" >> ~/.bashrc
    source ~/.bashrc
    ```

You should now be able to run any of the packages within the `turtlebot3_navigation2_tutorials` folder.

## Project Structure

### Documentation

Contains documentation related to the project, including the dissertation, guides for ROS setup, diagrams for project architectures, and any additional documentation needed throughout the project.

### Launch Scripts

Contains bash scripts for launching `nav2_launch` files, both for real and simulation environments. These scripts experiment with different global planners, including default planners such as Dijkstra and A*, as well as our custom planner server implementations (RRT, A*, and Dijkstra).

### Maps

Contains the 2D occupancy grid PGM files and associated YAML files generated by SLAM. These files are utilized by the Navigation2 stack for different environments tested during the project.

### Params

This folder contains custom `param.xml` files used by the Navigation2 stack to define behavior trees. These `param.xml` files have been customized to use different planner algorithms, including default Dijkstra, A*, and our custom planner server.

### Pkgs

This is the main directory of our project, containing several ROS 2 packages:
- **custom_planner_plugin**: Contains the code for our custom planner plugin ([information](./pkgs/custom_planner_plugin/README.md))
- **wall_follower**: Contains the wall follower algorithm which drives the robot around the edges of the maps ([information](./pkgs/wall_follower/README.md))

## Dissertation

The outcomes of this project, along with discussions on experiment implementation and other relevant details, are documented in my dissertation: [link](./documentation/dissertation/mckee_ryan_40294886__Dissertation.docx)
