# TURTLEBOT(s) navigation: "Cut & Glue" trajectories
This project aims to develop an autonomous TurtleBot capable of navigating flat indoor terrain using advanced robotics and motion planning techniques within the ROS environment. Equipped with LiDAR and powerful motor control, the TurtleBot 3 Burger serves as the ideal platform for this endeavor.

## Objectives:
1. Understand mobile robot dynamics and planning methods.
2. Assemble and integrate TurtleBot 3 with ROS.
3. Develop and implement planning algorithms in simulation and in real world.
4. Conduct a series of experiments to evaluate the navigation system's performance under various scenarios and associated costs.

## Setup:

### Setup: Pre-requisites
This project was made and used on ROS Humble with ubuntu 22.04 in mind. Please ensure you have HUmble or a compatable version of ROS setup up with the dependency packages for this project including SLAM-cargographer, ros2-navigation and turtlebot3 and colcon build tools If you need an in detail set by step guide on setting up your envrionment ([tutorial](https://gitlab.eeecs.qub.ac.uk/40294886/turtlebot_navigation-cut_and_glue_trajectories/-/blob/b33d09b1353e20f2beaf6e88cc33a92bc51d501b/documentation/ros2_turtlebot3_setup_guide.md))

### Setup: Install
Clone the reporitory in your colcon ros2 workspace.
```bash
cd ~/ros2_ws/src
git clone https://gitlab.eeecs.qub.ac.uk/40294886/turtlebot_navigation-cut_and_glue_trajectories.git
```

Install dependencies for the the ros packages in the project.
```bash
cd ~.ros2_ws/ && rosdep install --from-paths src --ignore-src -r -y
```

Build the colcon workspace using symlink-install for workspace storage otimzation improved package management
```bash
cd ~/ros2_ws/ && colcon build --symlink-install
```

Source the project ()this will source the setup.bash file for bootstrapping your ros2_ws for use within your ros environment, only add this once) 
```bash
echo "source ~/ros2_ws/install/setup.bash" >> ~/.bashrc
```
you should now be able to run any of the packages wihin the turtlebot3_navigtaion2_tutorials folder.

## Project structure
### documenation
Contains documenation relating the the project including disseration, guides for ros setup, diagrams for project archetectures and any additional documenation I needed throughout the project

#### launch_scripts
Contains real and simulation bash scripts for launching nav2_launch files with different global planners experimented with throughout this project, including already developed default planners such as dijkstra and A* as well as our custom planner server rrt, a* and dijkstra implmenations.
For information about how to use these laucnh scripts and how they work: ([Information](<add link to information about how to use launch scripts>))

#### Maps
Contains the 2d occupancy grid pgm and associated yamls generated by SLAM for utilization by the navigation2 stack for different environments tested during the course of this project

#### params
This folder contains the custom param.xml's used by the navigation2 stack for definition of behaviour tree's. These param.xmls have been customised to used different planner algorithms including default dijkstra, a_star and our custom_planner_server. 

#### pkgs
This is the main directory of our project, it contains several different ros2 packages.
- custom_planner_plugin: Contains the code for our custom_planner_plguin ([information](<Link document discussing archetecture and how this works as well as containing videos of different custom planner algorithms running>))
- nav2_straightline_planner: This is the straightline planner example from this tutorial: (https://navigation.ros.org/plugin_tutorials/docs/writing_new_nav2planner_plugin.html) with a fix that makes it work with ros2 humble
- wall_follower: This is the wall follower algorithms which has the robot drive around the edges of the maps ([infomration](link to markdown discussing this))
- ros2_demos: This is a package containing several different demos I created myself during the construct course practicing different ros2 concepts. 

## Disseration
Outcomes of this project and discussion on experiments implemneation and everything else are contained within my dissertation: ([link](<disseration link>))
